Week 7 of Web Security Class

#### Version 4.2 of Wordpress

2. Here we are performing an XSS attack by putting in a comment that when hovered over pops an alert

 3. This is another example of an xss attack where we are adding a link and adding an alert to the end of it
  * <img src = "week7part3.gif"/>
